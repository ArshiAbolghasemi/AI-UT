        "Consider that we have a knapsack, and we want to go on a picnic. We have some snacks that we want to take with us. Each snack has a value, and we also have a certain amount of each snack that we can take as much as we want. It's obvious that if we take half of a snack, we will have half its value. Also there is some constraints:\n",
        "- The sum of the values of our snacks shouldn't exceed a special amount that is given to us.\n",
        "- The number of snacks that we pick should be within the interval that is given to us.\n",
        "- The amount of the chosen snack shouldn't exceed the available amount of it.\n",

        "- **Gene**: In the context of this problem, each gene represents an item and the chosen amount. If we don't choose an item, its value is equal to zero; otherwise, it is equal to the amount chosen.\n",
        "- **Chromosome**: A chromosome is a collection of genes that represents a potential solution to the knapsack problem. It encodes a set of items to be included in the knapsack.\n"
