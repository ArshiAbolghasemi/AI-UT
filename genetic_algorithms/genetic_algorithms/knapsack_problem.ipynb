        "> If we have too small an initial population, we will have less diversity, and the only diversity we have is generated by mutation. Therefore, if our population does not move in the proper direction, we may reach the answer very late. On the other hand, too much initial population size increases memory usage and execution time.\n",

However, doing so may result in suboptimal performance or failure to find optimal solutions, depending on the characteristics of the problem being solved.\n",

Also, it may have happened because of our selection that we only have high-ranked chromosomes and so we lose our diversity after a few steps. For solving this problem one of our approaches is to select the chromosomes that the lower-ranked chromosomes are in the population to7. prevent losing our diversity.\n",
