Therefore, if our population does not move in the proper direction, we may reach the answer very late. On the other hand, too much initial population size increases memory usage and execution time.\n",

        "It helps in escaping local optima by exploring new areas of the search space.\n",
        "It can prevent premature convergence by introducing small, random changes to individual solutions.\n",

However, doing so may result in suboptimal performance or failure to find optimal solutions, depending on the characteristics of the problem being solved.\n",

Also, it may have happened because of our selection that we only have high-ranked chromosomes and so we lose our diversity after a few steps. For solving this problem one of our approaches is to select the chromosomes that the lower-ranked chromosomes are in the population to7. prevent losing our diversity.\n",
